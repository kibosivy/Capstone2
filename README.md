# Consumer Complaints Data Analysis

This project analyzes consumer complaint data from 2014 to 2024 to uncover key insights and trends that can help identify problematic companies and understand consumer behavior. The analysis focuses on:

- **Top Companies with Most Complaints:** Identifying the companies receiving the highest volume of complaints overall and year-by-year to spot persistent issues.
- **Complaint Volume Trends:** Examining how the total number of complaints changes over time, both annually and monthly, to detect seasonal patterns or shifts in consumer dissatisfaction.
- **Reporting Channels:** Analyzing the most frequently used complaint submission methods (e.g., web, phone, email) each year to understand consumer preferences and potential channel effectiveness.

### Visualizations Included:
- Bar charts showing the top 10 companies with the most complaints across all years.
- Yearly bar charts of the top 5 companies with the most complaints to highlight consistent problem areas.
- Line charts tracking the volume of complaints per year to observe overall trends.
- Multi-line graphs of monthly complaint counts for each year to identify seasonal spikes.
- Bar charts of the most used complaint submission channels broken down by year.

This analysis provides actionable insights for consumer protection agencies, companies looking to improve service, and researchers studying complaint behavior.
